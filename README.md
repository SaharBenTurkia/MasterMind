Kata Problem Solving - Java

Problem Description
The idea of this Kata is to code an algorithm capable of playing this boring role: answering the number of well placed and misplaced colors.

Therefore, the function should return, for a secret and a guessing combination:

- the number of well placed colors
- the number of correct but misplaced colors
A combination can contain any number of pegs but youâ€™d better give the same number for the secret and the guessing.

Clues
Start by detecting well placed colors.
Detecting misplaced colors is about counting them
